## HOL5318: Integrating Helidon and Oracle WebLogic on Kubernetes/Oracle Cloud Infrastructure ##

### About this hands-on workshop ###

This hands on lab demonstrates how to deploy WebLogic applications and Helidon microservices on Kubernetes on OCI. Helidon micorservice will implement a particular function of the application which is being implemented microservices Strangler patterns.

This lab is designed for people with no prior experience with Kubernetes, Docker, WebLogic, Helidon and want to learn the core concepts and basics of how to run WebLogic JEE and Helidon microservices application on Kubernetes environment.

The demo application is a simple Bank application written in Java using Java EE (JSF/PrimeFaces, Rest Client) and deployed to [Oracle WebLogic Application Server](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/weblogic.html).
The new function calculates Credit Score value based on account owner's name, date of birth and SSN. This Credit Score  application is implemented using [Helidon](https://helidon.io/#/) SE.
Both components run on [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/ContEng/Concepts/contengoverview.htm) using [WebLogic Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator)

Oracle services being used during the hands-on are the following:

+ **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** which combines the elasticity and utility of public cloud with the granular control, security, and predictability of on-premises infrastructure to deliver high-performance, high availability and cost-effective infrastructure services.
+ **Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)** is an Oracle managed Kubernetes Cluster enviroment to deploy and run container packaged applications.

The lab describes user interface available on September, 2019.

**Architecture**

### The topics to be covered in this hands-on session are: ###

1. [Build Bank Web Application and deploy on WebLogic running on Kubernetes](tutorials/1.build.bank.webapp.md)
2. [Develop new Credit Score function as microservice using Helidon SE and deploy on Kubernetes](2.build.creditscore.helidon.microservice.md)
3. [Modify Bank Web Application to use Credit Score microservice and deploy on Kubernetes](3.modify.bank.webapp.md)

### Environment Details ###

In this hands on lab you will use
- Shared Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes (Kubernetes Cluster)
- Shared WebLogic Domain deployed on Kubernetes Cluster

The necessary details to have access to the environment is set using variables:

|Variable Name|Value|Note|
| ----------- | --- | -- |
|PARTICIPANT_ID|Instructor provides|Unique ID for each participant|
|WLS_SERVER|Configured|IP address and port number of WebLogic Administrator server
|WLS_ADMIN_USER|Configured|Administrator's user name|
|WLS_ADMIN_PASSWORD|Configured|Administrator's password|
|WLS_TARGET|Configured| Name of the deployment target (cluster or individual server)|
|OCIR_USERNAME|Configured|User name to access container registry|
|OCIR_PASSWORD|Configured|Password to access container registry|

The only variable what you have to set is the PARTICIPANT_ID. Please wait for the instructor who will allocate a unique PARTICIPANT_ID for you. When you have your number execute the following:
```bash
export PARTICIPANT_ID=INSTRUCTOR_PROVIDED_UNIQUE_NUMBER
```
For example:
```bash
export PARTICIPANT_ID=777
```
Anytime when you open new terminal always set the PARTICIPANT_ID using the command above.
