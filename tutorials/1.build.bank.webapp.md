### Build Bank Web Application and deploy on WebLogic running on Kubernetes ###

#### Prepare the environment variables to use the shared WebLogic Domain ####

The Java EE application is ready to build using Maven. The Maven build also contains deploy step using `curl` against WebLogic REST Management interface. All the necessary values set by environment variables except PARTICIPANT_ID which has to be done by you.

Check the WebLogic Domain using the Administration console. To get the IP address read the WLS_SERVER, WLS_ADMIN_USER, WLS_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable's values.
```bash
echo $WLS_SERVER
echo $WLS_ADMIN_USER
echo $WLS_ADMIN_PASSWORD
```
Open a browser and copy the WLS_SERVER variable's result from above and append '/console', like: `http://150.136.197.31:80/console`. The console page opens. Enter the user name and password using the result from above and click __Login__

Select _Deployments_ in the left tree menu to verify what applications are deployed. You may see deployed applications, but you should not see such application which name contains your PARTICIPANT_ID (your unique number).

#### Build and deploy Bank Web Application ####

No use the terminal where the environment variables were set and change to the web application source directory.
```bash
cd /u01/content/wls-helidon
```
Build the Bank Web Application using Maven:
```bash
mvn clean package
```
At the end of the build you have to see similar output which contains the SUCCESS information twice. First for the deployment (`"message": "Deployed the application 'bestbank101'.", "severity": "SUCCESS"`) and second for the complete Maven build (`[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS`):
```bash

You can check the application first on the administration console.

Open the application using the WebLogic Server's IP address and the following context path format: `/bestbank<PARTICIPANT_ID>`. For example: `http://150.136.197.41/bestbank101/`.

Now your initial version of BestBank Web Application is deployed. You can move forward to the [next step](2.build.creditscore.helidon.microservice.md).
