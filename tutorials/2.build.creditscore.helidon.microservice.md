### Develop new Credit Score function as microservice using Helidon SE and deploy on Kubernetes ###

#### Develop Credit Score microservices application using Helidon ####

Helidon is the new Java microservice framework that has been open sourced recently by Oracle. Helidon basically is a collection of Java libraries for writing microservices. Helidon provides supports two programming models for writing microservices: Helidon SE and Helidon MP.
Helidon SE (used by this tutorial) is the functional programming style provided by all Helidon libraries.
Helidon MP is our MicroProfile implementation. [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/) is a platform definition that is familiar to enterprise Java developers. It provides a declarative programming style that is portable. It includes popular Java APIs such as JAX-RS and CDI.

Use the same terminal where the environment variables are already set or do it again. Change the directory to the `workspaces` directory:
```bash
cd /u01/workspace/
```

Generate the project sources using Helidon SE Maven archetypes. The result is a simple project that shows the basics of configuring the WebServer and implementing basic routing rules.
```bash
mvn archetype:generate -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=io.helidon.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=helidon-quickstart-se \
    -DarchetypeVersion=1.2.0 \
    -DgroupId=io.helidon.bestbank \
    -DartifactId=helidon-creditscore-se \
    -Dpackage=io.helidon.bestbank.creditscore
```
When the project generation is ready open the `Main.java` for edit:
```bash
gedit helidon-creditscore-se/src/main/java/io/helidon/bestbank/creditscore/Main.java &
```
Add _creditscore_ route which is basically the context path for the service endpoint. Find the `createRouting` method (at line 96) and register the new route. The complete `createRouting` method has to look like the following:
```java
private static Routing createRouting(Config config) {

    MetricsSupport metrics = MetricsSupport.create();
    GreetService greetService = new GreetService(config);
    HealthSupport health = HealthSupport.builder()
            .add(HealthChecks.healthChecks())   // Adds a convenient set of checks
            .build();

    return Routing.builder()
            .register(JsonSupport.create())
            .register(health)                   // Health at "/health"
            .register(metrics)                  // Metrics at "/metrics"
            .register("/greet", greetService)
            //THIS IS THE ONLY LINE YOU HAVE TO ADD:
            .register("/creditscore", new CreditscoreService())
            //END OF ADDED SECTION
            .build();
}

```
Now create a new class called `CreditscoreService` in the same package where the `Main.java` is located:
```bash
gedit helidon-creditscore-se/src/main/java/io/helidon/bestbank/creditscore/CreditscoreService.java &
```
Copy the following into the newly created file in `gedit`:
```java
package io.helidon.bestbank.creditscore;

import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

import javax.json.Json;
import javax.json.JsonObject;

import io.helidon.webserver.Routing;
import io.helidon.webserver.ServerRequest;
import io.helidon.webserver.ServerResponse;
import io.helidon.webserver.Service;

/**
 *
 */

public class CreditscoreService implements Service {

	private final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(this.getClass().getName());

	private static final int SCORE_MAX = 800;
	private static final int SCORE_MIN = 550;

	/**
	 * A service registers itself by updating the routine rules.
	 *
	 * @param rules the routing rules.
	 */
	@Override
	public final void update(final Routing.Rules rules) {
		rules
			.get("/healthcheck", this::getTestMessage)
			.post("/", this::postMethodCreditscore);
	}

    /**
     * Return a test greeting message.
     * @param request the server request
     * @param response the server response
     */
    private void getTestMessage(final ServerRequest request,
                                   final ServerResponse response) {

        JsonObject returnObject = Json.createObjectBuilder()
                .add("message", "The creditscore provider is running.")
                .build();
        response.send(returnObject);
    }

	/**
     * POST method to return a customer data including creditscore value, using the data that was provided.
     * @param request the server request
     * @param response the server response
     */
	private void postMethodCreditscore(final ServerRequest request,
            final ServerResponse response) {

		request.content()
		.as(JsonObject.class)
		.thenAccept(json -> {
		    logger.log(Level.INFO, "Request: {0}", json);
		    response.send(
		            Json.createObjectBuilder(json)
		                    .add("score", calculateCreditscore(json.getString("firstname"), json.getString("lastname"),
		            				json.getString("dateofbirth"), json.getString("ssn")))
		                    .build()
		    );
		});
	}

	/**
	 * calculate creditscore based on customer's properties
	 * @param firstname
	 * @param lastname
	 * @param dateofbirth
	 * @param ssn
	 * @return
	 */
	private int calculateCreditscore(String firstname, String lastname, String dateofbirth, String ssn) {

		int score = Math.abs(firstname.hashCode() + lastname.hashCode()
				+ dateofbirth.hashCode() + ssn.hashCode());

		score = score % SCORE_MAX;

		while (score < SCORE_MIN) {
			score = score + 100;
		}
		return score;
	}

}
```
Please note the code above accepts a GET for healthcheck and POST method to calculate the credit score value based on the account owner's details which passed using JSON.

Build the project:
```bash
cd /u01/workspace/helidon-creditscore-se/
mvn package
```
After a successful build run the microservice application on the desktop and test the endpoints. Before starting the application open a new terminal -because the running application will lock the terminal- using the following command to keep environment variables setting:
```bash
gnome-terminal
```
Use one of the terminal to start the application:
```bash
java -jar target/helidon-creditscore-se.jar
```
Using the other terminal test the locally running application's endpoints. First the GET method which provides simple health check:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/creditscore/healthcheck
```
The result has to be the following:
```bash
{"message":"The creditscore provider is running."}
```
Now test the credit score function:
```bash
curl \
   -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
   -H "Accept:application/json" \
   -d \
'{
  "id":null,"firstname":"Peter",
  "lastname":"Nagy",
  "dateofbirth":"09/12/1979",
  "ssn":"123-12-3123"
}' \
-X POST http://localhost:8080/creditscore | json_pp
```
The result contains the credit score value:
```bash
{
  "id":null,"firstname":"Peter",
  "lastname":"Nagy",
  "dateofbirth":"09/12/1979",
  "ssn":"123-12-3123",
  "score":593
}
```
Stop the running microservices application using __Ctrl+C__ in the terminal where you started the application.

#### Build Docker image ####

The application is ready for packaging using container format.
The Helidon project also contains a `Dockerfile` so that you can easily build a Docker image. In the terminal where the maven build for microservices application was done and the environment variables was set, execute the following:
```bash
docker build -t iad.ocir.io/showitbuildit1/helidon-creditscore-app:$PARTICIPANT_ID .
```
It may take some time. Note the name of the container image. `iad.ocir.io/showitbuildit1` part is an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry (OCIR) instance. The unique identifier of your image now is the tag. The tag will be your PARTICIPANT_ID.

When the Docker build is ready you can check your image:
```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                           TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
iad.ocir.io/showitbuildit1/helidon-creditscore-app   101                 1528ebd8d19a        11 hours ago        190MB
<none>                                               <none>              a1d6a55d3e91        11 hours ago        906MB
openjdk                                              8-jre-slim          624624f99e2f        3 weeks ago         184MB
maven                                                3.5.4-jdk-9         4d3f7a2574cb        12 months ago       875MB
```
Test your image. Use the `docker run` command to run locally your containerized application:
```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 iad.ocir.io/showitbuildit1/helidon-creditscore-app:$PARTICIPANT_ID
```
The container will run in foreground so you have to use a different terminal to test. If you need to open a new terminal use the following command to preserve the environment variables settings:
```bash
gnome-terminal
```
Execute the test again:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/creditscore/healthcheck
```
Stop the running container using __Ctrl+C__ in the terminal where the container is running.

#### Push application image to Container Registry ####

The container image name already conform to the Registry name so you can use the `push` command to upload. But first you need to login to the registry using the environment variables:
```bash
docker login iad.ocir.io \
  -u="showitbuildit1/oow19" \
  -p="$OCIR_PASSWORD"
```
Aftet the successful login upload the container image to the registry:
```bash
docker push iad.ocir.io/showitbuildit1/helidon-creditscore-app:$PARTICIPANT_ID
```
#### Deploy Creditscore Microservices Application on OKE ####

To ensure proper separation of the applications and/or users  Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces. The WebLogic Domain is running in a separate namespace. Your microservices application will run in a unique namespace. To interact with the Kubernetes cluster you have to use `kubectl` which is the Kubernetes CLI.

Create your namespace:
```bash
kubectl create namespace helidon$PARTICIPANT_ID
```
To deploy the application on Kubernetes you need to have the resource definition which contains the _Deployment_ and _Service_ details. For the Creditscore Microservices Application you can find the pre-created resource definition in the `/u01/content/wls-helidon/k8s/app.creditscore.yaml`. The file is ready to use. We displayed it here just for your information (don't copy into terminal):
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: helidon-creditscoreservice
  namespace: helidon$PARTICIPANT_ID
  labels:
    app: helidon-creditscore
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    name: http
  selector:
    app: helidon-creditscore
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: helidon-creditscore
  namespace: helidon$PARTICIPANT_ID
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: helidon-creditscore
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: helidon-creditscore
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: helidon-creditscore
        image: iad.ocir.io/showitbuildit1/helidon-creditscore-app:$PARTICIPANT_ID
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: ocirsecret
```
Please note the lower _Deployment_ part which contains your image location in the container registry. Before the execution the $PARTICIPANT_ID variable will be replaced.
However to pull your image from the repository Kubernetes needs to authenticate. A Kubernetes cluster uses the _Secret_ of `docker-registry` type to authenticate with a container registry to pull a private image. This secret name is defined as __ocirsecret__ in the _Deployment_ configuration. Create this secret for container registry using the `create secret` command:
```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry ocirsecret \
  -n helidon$PARTICIPANT_ID \
  --docker-server=iad.ocir.io \
  --docker-username='showitbuildit1/oow19' \
  --docker-password=$OCIR_PASSWORD \
  --docker-email=email@example.com
```
Now replace the $PARTICIPANT_ID in the yaml resource defintion file and deploy your Creditscore Microservices Application to Kubernetes cluster using this single line one command:
```bash
envsubst < /u01/content/wls-helidon/k8s/app.creditscore.yaml | kubectl apply -n helidon$PARTICIPANT_ID -f -
```
Check your pod (container):
```bash
$ kubectl get pod -n helidon$PARTICIPANT_ID
NAME                                   READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
helidon-creditscore-5658c5686d-vdtrw   1/1       Running   0          26m
```
You can check the service:
```bash
$ kubectl get service -n helidon$PARTICIPANT_ID
NAME                         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
helidon-creditscoreservice   ClusterIP   10.96.166.178   <none>        8080/TCP   45m
```
To test externally the running application on Kubernetes you should have to assign LoadBalancer/Public IP. But it is not recommended to expose the internally used microservices endpoints. Instead of enabling public access use `kubectl port-forward` which is similar to `ssh tunnel` in Kubernetes environment and allows you to connect to your service.
Before open the connections make sure you have another terminal to test because port forward also runs as a foreground process and locks the screen. If you need to open a new terminal use the following command to preserve the environment variables settings:
```bash
gnome-terminal
```
Using on of the available terminal execute the following to setup the port forward:
```bash
kubectl port-forward deployment/helidon-creditscore 7000:8080 -n helidon$PARTICIPANT_ID
```
In the another terminal execute the test `curl` command using `localhost:7000` address as a result of port forwarding:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:7000/creditscore/healthcheck
```
The result has to be the following:
```bash
{"message":"The creditscore provider is running."}
```
Stop the `kubectl` port forwarding using __Ctrl+C__ in the terminal where that is running.

Now your Creditscore Microservices Application is properly running on Oracle Kubernetes Engine. You can move forward to the [next step](3.modify.bank.webapp.md).
